# AI Assistants Evaluation

## This repository contains code generated by AI code assistants based on provided prompts. 

### Description

Generative AI is an emerging technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way humans interact with computers. 
It is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses vast amounts of data to generate new content. 
Generative AI is already being used in a variety of ways, from creating art to writing news articles.

For the comparison of the quality of the generated **Python** code, we used the following code assistants:
- [Amazon CodeWhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/)
- [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/)
- [GPT4 Code Interpreter](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#code-interpreter)

### Structure

The repository contains the following folders:
- `code_readability` - contains the readability code examples
- `code_testing` - contains the unit tests generated by the assistants
- `creativity` - contains the creativity code examples
- `debugging` - contains the examples of code debugging / troubleshooting
- `security` - contains the security code examples

Each folder contains a number of subfolders. Each subfolder consists of three Python files each named by a corresponding code assistant.
Each Python file contains the prompt and the generated code. 
**Only the first prompt was written by a developer.**

Note: for `debugging` tests, the code 'before' is displayed above and the code 'after' is displayed below.

### Evaluation

The following aspects were evaluated:
- **Code quality** - how well the generated code works
- **Code style** - how well the generated code follows the style guide
- **Code readability** - how easy it is to understand the generated code
- **Code security** - how secure the generated code is
- **Creativeness** - how creative the generated code is
- **Unit tests generation** - how well the assistant generates unit tests for the code
- **Troubleshooting** - how well the assistant helps to troubleshoot / debug the code

### Results

The results of the evaluation are presented in the table below:
