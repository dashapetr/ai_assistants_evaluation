# open a local file based on user input

# Opening a local file based on user input in Python is straightforward using the built-in open function.
# However, you should be careful when dealing with user input, as it can lead to security vulnerabilities,
# such as directory traversal attacks, where a malicious user could
# potentially access files outside of the intended directory.
#
# Here's a simple example, along with some basic input validation:

import os

# Get the path to the directory containing allowable files (e.g., a safe directory)
SAFE_DIRECTORY = '/path/to/safe/directory'

def read_file(file_name):
    # Ensure the file is within the safe directory
    full_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(SAFE_DIRECTORY, file_name))
    if not full_path.startswith(SAFE_DIRECTORY):
        print("Error: Attempted directory traversal attack or invalid file path.")
        return

    try:
        with open(full_path, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
            print(content)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading file: {e}")

# Get user input
user_input = input("Enter the name of the file you want to read: ")
read_file(user_input)

# In the above code:
#
# We define a SAFE_DIRECTORY which contains the files the user is allowed to access.

# The read_file function ensures that the provided file_name is within the SAFE_DIRECTORY.
# This is done using os.path.abspath to get the absolute path,
# and then checking that it starts with the SAFE_DIRECTORY path.

# If the file is in the safe directory, we proceed to read and print its content.
# If there's an error (e.g., file doesn't exist, insufficient permissions),
# we catch the exception and print an error message.

# Remember, always validate user input, especially when it affects file or database operations,
# to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
