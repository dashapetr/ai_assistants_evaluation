# visualization for geo data

# Visualizing geographical (or geo) data often involves displaying data on maps.
# Depending on the nature of the geo data, different types of visualizations might be suitable.
# Here are some of the popular ways to visualize geo data:
#
# Point Maps:
# Display individual points on a map. Each point corresponds to a specific location (latitude, longitude).
#
# Heatmaps:
# Represent data density in areas with a gradient of colors.
# Areas with higher densities or intensities are usually shown in warmer colors.
#
# Choropleth Maps:
# Divide the map into regions, and each region is colored based on a metric.
# For example, you could show average income by state using a choropleth map.
#
# Line Maps:
# Display lines connecting points, often used to represent routes or paths.
#
# Bubble Maps:
# Similar to point maps, but the size of each point (or bubble) varies based on an associated metric.
#
# There are several Python libraries available for geo data visualization:
#
# Folium: Interactive map visualization using Leaflet.js.
# Geopandas: Extends the Pandas library to enable spatial operations and comes with built-in visualization capabilities.
# Plotly: Offers interactive plots, including geographical visualizations.
# Basemap: Part of Matplotlib's toolkit for map projections and visualizations.
# I'll demonstrate creating a basic point map using the folium library.
# Let's say we want to visualize a few cities on a map:
#
# (Note: For real-world applications, you might need to install the necessary libraries, e.g., pip install folium.)

import folium

# Create a base map
m = folium.Map(location=[20,0], zoom_start=2)

# Sample data: City names and their coordinates
cities = {
    "Los Angeles": [34.05, -118.24],
    "New York": [40.71, -74.00],
    "London": [51.50, -0.12],
    "Tokyo": [35.68, 139.76],
    "Sydney": [-33.86, 151.20]
}

# Add points to the map
for city, coordinates in cities.items():
    folium.Marker(location=coordinates, tooltip=city).add_to(m)

# Display the map
m

# The map above displays markers for several cities around the world.
# By hovering over each marker, you'll see the city's name as a tooltip.
#
# This is a basic example of visualizing point data on a map using the folium library.
# Depending on your specific requirements and the nature of your geo data, you can use other visualization techniques
# and libraries as mentioned earlier.
