# visualization for categorical data

# Visualizing categorical data involves representing discrete values or labels, often in a non-numeric format.
# Several visualization techniques are suitable for categorical data:
#
# Bar Charts:
# Bar charts are one of the most common ways to visualize categorical data.
# Each category is represented by a bar, and the height (or length) of the bar corresponds
# to the frequency or proportion of that category.
#
# Pie Charts:
# Pie charts show categories as slices of a pie. The size of each slice corresponds to the proportion of that category.
# However, pie charts can become cluttered if there are too many categories.
#
# Box Plots:
# Box plots (or box-and-whisker plots) are useful for visualizing the distribution
# of a numeric variable across different categories.
#
# Count Plots:
# Similar to bar charts, but specifically used to show the counts of observations in each category.
#
# Violin Plots:
# Combines aspects of box plots and density plots to show the distribution of numeric data across
# different categorical levels.
#
# Categorical Scatter Plots:
# Displays individual data points for each category, often with some "jitter" added to avoid overplotting.
#
# Let's demonstrate some of these using the seaborn library and the tips dataset,
# which contains categorical data on days of the week and meal times.
# We'll visualize the distribution of total bill amounts across different days of the week.
#
# First, we'll need to import the necessary libraries and load the dataset.

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the 'tips' dataset from seaborn
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
tips.head()

# It seems there was an issue with the execution.
# Nonetheless, I'll continue explaining how to visualize the categorical data.
#
# Given that you've loaded the tips dataset, here's how you can create some of the aforementioned visualizations:
#
# Bar Chart:

sns.barplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips)
plt.title('Average Total Bill Amount by Day')
plt.show()

# Box Plot:

sns.boxplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips)
plt.title('Distribution of Total Bill Amount by Day')
plt.show()

# Violin Plot:

sns.violinplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips)
plt.title('Distribution of Total Bill Amount by Day')
plt.show()

# Count Plot:

sns.countplot(x='day', data=tips)
plt.title('Count of Records by Day')
plt.show()

# Categorical Scatter Plot with Jitter:

sns.stripplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips, jitter=True)
plt.title('Total Bill Amounts by Day')
plt.show()

# You can run the code snippets above in your local environment to visualize
# the distribution of the total_bill column across different days of the week using the tips dataset.
# Adjust the x, y, and data parameters as needed to visualize other columns or datasets.
